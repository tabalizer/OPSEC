## Core rule (one line)
Isolate **Device ‚áÑ Network ‚áÑ Identity ‚áÑ Behavior**. Plan objective, threat model, and burn before creation.

---

## One-line SOP (copy / paste)
Isolated device ‚Üí private network (public access ‚Üí VPN/ Tor) ‚Üí puppet email + alias ‚Üí temp number (only if required) ‚Üí verify ‚Üí enable TOTP/hardware key ‚Üí seed slowly ‚Üí monitor ‚Üí burn on schedule.

---

## Top 5 priorities (do these first)
1. OPSEC plan: objective, threat model, accepted risks, burn date, encrypted OPSEC log.  
2. Device separation: physical burner **or** live OS (Tails) / Whonix VM on separate hardware; verify checksums.  
3. Network separation: public Wi-Fi or separate mobile data ‚Üí optional VPN ‚Üí Tor for account creation. Never use home/work IPs.  
4. Credentials: ProtonMail/Tutanota + SimpleLogin/AnonAddy aliases; KeePassXC offline vault.  
5. Auth hardening: enable TOTP and/or YubiKey immediately after verification; treat SMS as temporary.

---

## Minimum ordered checklist (execute in sequence)
1. Create OPSEC plan and burn policy.  
2. Prepare isolated device (burner phone or Tails/Whonix VM).  
3. Acquire isolated network access (public Wi-Fi or prepaid mobile data).  
4. Create puppet email + alias, unique password.  
5. Obtain temp number per decision guide and use only for initial SMS.  
6. Verify service, add TOTP/hardware key, remove phone from profile if allowed.  
7. Seed account: 5‚Äì15 benign interactions over days to build credibility.  
8. Monitor signals; rotate or burn on schedule.

## Temporary phone numbers ‚Äî decision & practical SOP

**Selection guide (threat ‚Üí practicality):**
- **High OPSEC:** cash-bought prepaid physical SIM (best separation if lawful).  
- **Moderate OPSEC:** reputable paid burner apps (Hushed, Burner, MySudo) bought anonymously.  
- **Low OPSEC / convenience:** mainstream VoIP (TextNow, Google Voice) ‚Äî often blocked.  
- **Avoid for serious use:** free public ‚Äúreceive-SMS‚Äù websites.

**Acquisition SOP (step-by-step):**
1. Choose method per threat model; log provider and burn date.  
2. **Cash SIM:** buy with cash at unrelated retailer ‚Üí insert only in burner device ‚Üí activate over public Wi-Fi or prepaid data. Confirm local legality.  
3. **Burner app:** register on burner device over Tor/VPN ‚Üí pay with privacy-preserving method (prepaid/ gift card or lawful crypto) ‚Üí use app only on burner device.  
4. Use number for initial SMS verification only ‚Üí immediately provision TOTP or register a YubiKey ‚Üí remove number from profile if possible.  
5. Set lifecycle (30‚Äì90 days). Burn: unlink number, delete/neutralize account, factory reset device, destroy SIM.

**Hard rules:** one number per puppet; never link to your real device, identity, or payment method.

## Device & network ‚Äî practical setup
- **Physical burner:** keep solely for puppet; no personal accounts.  
- **Live OS / VM:** Tails (live USB) or Whonix (VM) on isolated hardware; verify images & signatures.  
- **Network flow:** public Wi-Fi / prepaid mobile data ‚Üí optional VPN ‚Üí Tor Browser for account actions.  
- **MAC & IDs:** spoof MAC when supported; disable auto backups/auto-connect features.

---

## Email, aliasing & password hygiene
- Use **ProtonMail** or **Tutanota** for puppet email.  
- Use **SimpleLogin** or **AnonAddy** for per-service aliases.  
- Generate long, unique passwords; store in **KeePassXC** (local vault) on the burner device or encrypted removable storage.  
- Immediately enable **TOTP** and/or **YubiKey** after verification; treat SMS as fallback only.

---

## Image & file hygiene ‚Äî exact commands to run (practical)
- Inspect metadata:
    exiftool image.jpg
- Remove all metadata (overwrite original):
    exiftool -overwrite_original -all= image.jpg
- Remove GPS only:
    exiftool -overwrite_original -gps:all= -xmp:geotag= image.jpg
- Re-render cleaned image: open cleaned file on burner VM and take a screenshot (removes hidden thumbnails/maker notes). Re-check with `exiftool` to confirm.

---

## Behavioral OPSEC ‚Äî concrete, actionable rules
- **Timing:** post during local hours consistent with puppet timezone; avoid burst posting.  
- **Style:** change sentence length, punctuation, idioms; use a simple style template and vary it.  
- **Social graph:** add a few benign contacts; make small interactions before outreach.  
- **No cross-linking:** never share cloud links, calendar invites, QR codes, or files that can map to your real identity.  
- **Media hygiene:** never upload original phone photos‚Äîuse AI-generated or licensed images, clean them, then re-render.

---

## Incident response & burn procedure (precise steps)
1. **Contain:** isolate device from networks; revoke sessions via platform controls if possible.  
2. **Audit:** export a minimal encrypted timeline/log for lessons learned (store separate from identifiers).  
3. **Account actions:** change profile data to neutral, then delete account where safe (note: deletion may be delayed or incomplete).  
4. **Device & SIM disposal:** factory reset phone, securely wipe VM images and keys, physically destroy SIM (cut/shred).  
5. **Post-burn verification:** monitor for residual activity or re-linkage attempts; rotate any related credentials.

## Templates (copy / paste)

**Puppet checklist (single line):**

PuppetName | Country | City | AgeRange | Email(proton) | Alias(simplelogin) | Number(provider) | 2FA(TOTP/YubiKey) | BurnDate(YYYY-MM-DD)

**Temp-number SOP (single line):**

Buy cash SIM ‚Üí activate on burner over public Wi-Fi/Tor ‚Üí verify ‚Üí enable TOTP/YubiKey ‚Üí remove phone from profile ‚Üí set burn date

## Recommended toolset (purpose mapped)
- **Anonymity / OS:** Tor Browser; Tails (live USB); Whonix (VM).  
- **Email & aliases:** ProtonMail; Tutanota; SimpleLogin; AnonAddy.  
- **Temp numbers:** Hushed; Burner; MySudo (paid). Avoid free SMS receivers.  
- **Metadata:** ExifTool (CLI).  
- **Passwords:** KeePassXC (offline vault).  
- **2FA / hardware:** YubiKey + Authenticator apps (TOTP).  
- **Guides:** EFF ‚Äî Surveillance Self-Defense; PrivacyTools.io for threat modeling.

---

## Quick risk & legal notes
- SMS is interceptable and increasingly blocked by platforms; prefer TOTP / hardware keys for ongoing access.  
- SIM registration and purchase laws vary‚Äîverify local regulations before buying/activating unregistered SIMs. Consult legal counsel for sensitive or high-risk operations.  
- This guide is defensive; do not use it to commit illegal acts.

## Final one-line rule
Plan first, isolate every identifier, use temp numbers only for verification, migrate to TOTP/hardware keys, clean & re-render media, set & execute a burn plan, and operate within the law and platform policies.
