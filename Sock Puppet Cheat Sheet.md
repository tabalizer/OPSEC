## 🎯 What is a Sock Puppet?

A **sock puppet** is a fully separated, false digital identity used for:

- Anonymous research  
- Whistleblowing  
- Red team testing  
- Secure persona separation (journalism, activism, etc.)  
- Risky online interactions  

> The goal: **Zero overlap** with your real identity (metadata, behavior, networks, accounts).

## 🛠️ Setup Checklist

| Component       | Guidance |
|----------------|----------|
| **Device**      | Use a burner phone or clean virtual machine (Tails, Whonix, or hardened Linux). Never mix real logins or IPs. |
| **Connection**  | Use **Tor** or a no-logs **VPN over Tor**. Avoid home/work IP addresses. Public Wi-Fi + Tor is best (with MAC spoofing). |
| **OS Fingerprint** | Avoid default user agents. Use hardened browsers or spoofing (Tor Browser randomizes this by default). |
| **Keyboard Language** | Set device language and keyboard layout to match your alias’ origin (i.e. not your native setup). |
| **Time Zone**   | Match the sock puppet’s fake location. Don’t leave browser/system clock in your actual time zone. |
| **Fonts & Locale** | Disable or spoof font fingerprinting. Clean machines only. |

## 🧬 Identity Creation

| Element          | Strategy |
|------------------|----------|
| **Name**         | Use a common name consistent with chosen country/region. Avoid famous names. |
| **Birthday**     | Random, realistic age (20–40 is safest). Avoid your real DOB, even reversed. |
| **Backstory**    | Build a 2–3 sentence believable persona. Avoid extremes (no spies, billionaires). Example: “Alex K., 28, graphic designer from Poland.” |
| **Profile Image**| Use AI-generated faces (e.g. [thispersondoesnotexist.com](https://thispersondoesnotexist.com)). Never use stock photos or stolen images. |
| **Location**     | Pick a mid-size city in your target region. Avoid capitals or rural towns. Match it to your IP, time zone, keyboard. |
| **Gender/Pronouns** | Use what fits your persona. Keep it consistent across platforms. |

---

## 📧 Email & Number

- Use **ProtonMail**, **Tutanota**, or **SimpleLogin** aliases.
- Sign up over Tor or VPN.
- Never reuse emails between puppets or between real and puppet.
- Use VoIP services like **MySudo**, **Hushed**, or **TextNow** (over VPN) for SMS verification.
- Use email aliasing tools (**AnonAddy**, **SimpleLogin**) for throwaway accounts.

## 🔐 Account Creation Tips

| Service Type     | Notes |
|------------------|-------|
| **Social Media** | Start with “seed” platforms (Reddit, Twitter/X, Discord). Use slow build-up. |
| **Activity Logs**| Avoid empty puppets — post a few benign comments to blend in. |
| **Username**     | Never overlap with real life. Use a name generator if needed. No inside jokes. |
| **Password**     | Unique, long, stored in an isolated password manager (KeePass/KeePassXC offline vault). |
| **Behavior**     | Don’t post in your real writing style. Use different slang, tone, and time-of-day activity. |
| **Browser Fingerprint** | Use Tor Browser or Firefox with containers (and canvas/font blocking). |

## 🚩 Don’ts (Common Mistakes)

- ❌ Logging in from home or work Wi-Fi  
- ❌ Reusing usernames, photos, or email formats  
- ❌ Talking about real events you’ve been involved in  
- ❌ Linking to real accounts or devices (via QR codes, calendar invites, etc.)  
- ❌ Leaving real EXIF/location data in shared images or docs  
- ❌ Using payment methods tied to you (card, bank, crypto wallet)

---

## 🧹 Maintenance & Burn

- 🧼 Keep your sock puppet active and credible (slow, consistent usage).
- 🔥 If compromised or exposed:  
  - Log out  
  - Delete accounts (if safe)  
  - Change device/MAC/IP  
  - Burn identity permanently and start over

## ✅ Summary

| Goal | Tool |
|------|------|
| Anonymized signup | Tor + ProtonMail + VoIP number |
| Fingerprint isolation | Tails, Whonix, Firefox with spoofing |
| Behavior separation | Different writing style, time zone, habits |
| Metadata control | No reuse of identifiers, accounts, devices |
