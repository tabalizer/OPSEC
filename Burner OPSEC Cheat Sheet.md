# 🔥 Burner Phone Guide (Non-Smartphone OPSEC Use)

## 🎯 Purpose  
Burner phones are temporary, disposable, and compartmentalized devices used to maintain anonymity, reduce metadata exposure, and isolate identities. Ideal for one-off contacts, risky travel, or separating personas.

## 📦 Recommended Devices

| Device Model        | Type         | Notes |
|---------------------|--------------|-------|
| **Nokia 105 / 225** | Dumbphone    | Very cheap, long battery, widely available. Often sold prepaid. No internet = minimal attack surface. |
| **Alcatel 1066**     | Dumbphone    | Small, affordable, common in EU convenience stores. |
| **Punkt MP02**       | Feature phone | Privacy-first, supports LTE and Signal (via tethering to laptop), not cheap. |
| **Light Phone II**   | Minimalist smart-feature phone | Encrypted VoIP (via Wi-Fi/LTE), stripped of apps/browser. Can be pseudonymous. |

> Avoid smartphones unless needed. The more features, the more vectors for compromise.

## 🛒 Buying the Burner

- ✅ **Buy in person** using **cash only**.
- ✅ **Avoid loyalty cards, ID checks, or surveillance areas** (camera-free kiosks or rural stores are best).
- ✅ **Don’t activate at point of purchase** – do it later, in a safe location.
- ✅ **Avoid bundles that auto-link SIM to your identity**.

---

## 📶 SIM Cards (and Anonymity)

- Use **prepaid SIMs** bought anonymously (varies by country).
- In the EU: Some countries still allow anonymous SIM purchase (e.g. Austria, Netherlands); check local laws.
- Use **roaming SIMs** or international travel SIMs to obscure real location.
- Disable voicemail. Use **SIM PIN** to prevent misuse if stolen.
- For extra anonymity, **rotate SIMs** and discard after use.

---

## 🧼 Setup Hygiene

1. **Power on only in safe locations** (never at home or work).
2. **Insert SIM only when needed**. Keep phone off or SIM removed when idle.
3. **Disable features** like Bluetooth, predictive text, location (if supported).
4. **Avoid contact syncing, call logs, or saved texts**.
5. **Use generic names** in contact list (e.g., "Plumber", "Office").

## 📱 Usage Best Practices

- 🔄 **One identity per burner**: Never mix personal and burner use.
- 📵 **Use for a purpose, then discard**: After the task, destroy or retire the device.
- 🧍‍♂️ **Don’t carry when not in use**: Especially when going to sensitive locations.
- 🗣️ **Keep calls/texts brief**: Minimal metadata = minimal exposure.
- 🕵️‍♂️ **Change behavior**: Use gloves if needed, avoid patterns (e.g. regular call times or fixed locations).
- ❌ **Never reuse SIMs or devices across identities**.

---

## 🪓 Disposal Protocol

- **Break SIM** into multiple pieces.
- **Physically destroy the phone**: Remove battery (if possible), smash or burn PCB.
- **Never throw away whole in trash** – it can be recovered.
- If you must keep it: Remove SIM, battery, and store in Faraday bag.

---

## 🚨 Warnings

- 🔌 Avoid USB charging in public places (juice jacking risk).
- 📡 Your carrier still sees tower connections (location leak possible).
- 🧬 Voice is biometric: Use code words or minimal conversation if OPSEC-critical.
- 🔍 Don’t trust “off” mode — some devices can be remotely activated (esp. advanced models).
