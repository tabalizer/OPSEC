| Cloning or forensics       | Officials create a full device copy for later analysis. |

## 📦 Prep Checklist (Before You Travel)

### 🔐 Secure Your Main Device
- Enable **Strong Passcode** (not biometrics).
- Turn on **Erase Data after 10 failed passcode attempts**.
- Disable **Face ID / Touch ID** before crossing.
- Enable **Lockdown Mode** (iOS) or use a minimal-profile (Android).
- Enable **Full-Disk Encryption** (mandatory on Android).
- Remove unnecessary apps, chats, photos, accounts.

### 📤 Offload Sensitive Data
- Use **end-to-end encrypted cloud storage** (Proton Drive, Tresorit).
- Upload critical files, wipe them from device, **clear “Recently Deleted”**.
- Do **not** leave encryption keys or passwords on the device.

### 📴 Prepare the Device for Confiscation
- Power off fully before arriving at the checkpoint.
- Do not carry unlocked, live devices past checkpoints.
- Leave your **main phone at home** if possible – carry only a clean/limited device.

## 📱 Recommended Strategy

### Option 1: **Carry a Burner Device Only**
- Use a dumbphone or feature phone with **anonymous SIM**.
- No apps, no accounts, no link to your identity.
- Load only what’s needed for travel (e.g., one VoIP contact or flight info).
- Power off or keep in Faraday bag when not in use.

### Option 2: **Clean Phone + Cloud Recovery**
- Wipe your real phone before crossing.
- Restore from cloud (encrypted backup) **after** passing border safely.
- Use “If Found” message on lock screen with a decoy email or VoIP number.
- Install dummy apps or leave as factory-reset.

## 💡 On the Spot: When You're Stopped

| Action                            | Notes                                                  |
|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Stay calm                         | Border searches are legal in many jurisdictions.       |
| Don't volunteer info              | Only answer what you're legally required to.           |
| Refuse biometric unlock           | In many countries, you **can’t be forced** to provide a passcode, but **can** be compelled to give fingerprint/face. |
| Request lawyer / delay tactic     | Politely ask for legal counsel if pressured.           |
| Don’t talk about encryption       | Don't mention “burner,” “encryption,” “OPSEC” – it draws attention. |
| If forced:                        | Give access to **decoy phone** or account with limited data. |

## 🧼 After the Border

- **Assume device was cloned** if it left your sight.
- Change all passwords, regenerate encryption keys.
- Reinstall a fresh OS image or discard the phone entirely.
- Review metadata and account logins for signs of compromise.

## 🛠️ Optional Tools

- **Proton Drive / Tresorit** – encrypted file storage for temporary offloading.
- **Faraday Bag** – blocks all signals (cell, Wi-Fi, GPS, NFC, etc.).
- **MySudo / Hushed** – decoy VoIP numbers.
- **Factory Reset / DFU Mode (iOS)** – to fully wipe phone before entry.
- **Strongbox / KeePassium** – for storing passwords offline in encrypted vaults.
- **Lockdown Mode (iOS)** – disables attack surfaces like unknown FaceTime, links, profiles.

## 🧭 Rule of Thumb:  
> *"Treat border crossings like adversarial environments. If you're not okay with customs seeing it, don’t bring it."*
