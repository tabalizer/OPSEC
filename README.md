## 🌍 Why This Matters — Especially in 2025

The need for practical OPSEC is more urgent than ever:

- 🛰️ **Mass surveillance has intensified**, with governments, private corporations, and AI-driven analytics collecting and correlating data on unprecedented scales.
- 🌐 **Geopolitical instability** (Ukraine, Taiwan, Middle East, etc.) has led to increased border scrutiny, forced device unlocks, and political profiling.
- 📱 **Phones are now evidence**: Your apps, movements, chats, and contacts can all be used to infer affiliations, beliefs, or associations — even if benign.
- 🚫 **Journalists, activists, travelers, and professionals** are being detained or questioned based on digital data alone — often without warrants or oversight.
- 🔐 **Zero-day surveillance tools** (e.g. Pegasus-like spyware) now target civilians more frequently, not just high-profile individuals.

This guide exists to protect your **basic rights to privacy, autonomy, and safety** — even in shifting legal, political, and digital environments.

If you’re crossing borders, organizing locally, reporting injustice, or simply living under regimes with aggressive digital policies, this knowledge is not optional — it’s **survival-grade hygiene**.
