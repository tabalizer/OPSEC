## 🎯 Purpose

Even with encrypted phones, secure SIMs, and perfect digital setups — a single careless phrase, photo, or reaction can destroy your anonymity or compromise your mission.

**Human OPSEC** is about *you*.  
How you move, speak, post, write, behave, and interact — especially when being watched, recorded, or profiled.

This applies to:
- Travelers  
- Journalists  
- Whistleblowers  
- Security staff  
- Business professionals  
- Anyone with a need for low-exposure movement

## 🔑 Core Principles of Human OPSEC

| Principle        | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| **Silence is safety** | If it’s not necessary, don’t say it — especially in public, online, or near devices |
| **Consistency** | Keep aliases, backstories, and digital/persona details aligned |
| **Minimalism** | Share only what’s needed. The less you say or show, the harder you are to profile |
| **Pattern discipline** | Avoid routines, repeated phrases, or behaviors that link identities |
| **Emotional control** | Surveillance often waits for emotional leaks: anger, panic, trust |

## 🗣️ Verbal Security: What You Say Matters

| Mistake | Risk |
|--------|------|
| Mentioning real names, events, places | Identity link or geolocation |
| Referencing tools like “VPN”, “burner”, “OPSEC” in casual speech | Flags your behavior as non-standard |
| Oversharing with strangers (“What do you do?”) | Inconsistent stories or unintended reveals |
| Using niche slang or accents | Can narrow down origin, culture, profession |
| Admitting intent (“I don’t want to be tracked”) | Now you're a target of interest |

### ✅ What To Do:
- Use general terms: “I work remote,” “I’m doing a short project”  
- Practice casual, forgettable small talk  
- Speak slowly and deliberately in high-pressure moments (border, customs)  
- Know your story — and stick to it  
- If pressured, deflect: “Sorry, I’m tired” or “Can we talk later?”

---

## 🧍 Body Language & Movement

- Don’t fidget, pace, or act agitated — it draws attention  
- Be confident, neutral, but unremarkable  
- Don’t appear evasive or too stiff — natural is key  
- Don’t rush in/out of buildings repeatedly (especially government or hotel sites)  
- Vary your path: Don’t use the same metro entrance every day

## 📷 Visual Footprint

| Threat | Fix |
|--------|-----|
| Being photographed | Wear neutral clothes, avoid memorable accessories |
| Being followed or profiled visually | Change hats/glasses, adjust posture, sit in different locations |
| Image leaks via social media | Strip metadata, delay posting, use filters that reduce detail |
| Repeating outfits across profiles | Use completely separate wardrobes for aliases if needed |

---

## 📱 Digital Behavior Hygiene

| Mistake | Consequence |
|---------|-------------|
| Typing style, grammar, punctuation reuse | Writing analysis can link real and alias identities |
| Using the same emoji, slang, or tone | Voiceprint by behavior |
| Same active hours (timezone pattern) | Reveals rough location or schedule |
| Cross-referencing accounts or usernames | Metadata link between real and alias identity |

### ✅ Digital Cleanliness:
- Use different writing styles on different platforms  
- Don’t engage with the same people across accounts  
- Keep photo style, post timing, and interaction habits compartmentalized  
- Don’t log into real accounts from alias devices — ever

---

## 🧬 Social Engineering Resistance

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "We just need to verify your identity quickly" | Decline politely. "I prefer to handle that later/in writing." |
| Friendly probing at hotels, cafes, airports | Keep answers vague and general |
| Flattery or sympathy as a tactic | Don’t overshare just because someone seems nice |
| Phishing (calls, emails, texts) | Always verify out-of-band. Never trust links or urgent requests |
| Authority pressure (uniform, badge, etc.) | Ask for written request, delay if possible, remain polite and firm |

---

## 🧠 Training Yourself

- Practice writing in different styles (short, emoji-heavy, overly formal, local slang)  
- Role-play travel interviews and border questions with a partner  
- Observe your routines: routes, login times, conversation patterns  
- Record yourself speaking and check for tells: phrases, pacing, verbal tics  
- Identify personal “tells” (hand gestures, phrases, pacing habits)
