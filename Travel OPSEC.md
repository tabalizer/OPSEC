## 🧭 Pre-Tour OPSEC Preparation

Before you even leave home, your OPSEC planning should begin. This phase ensures you’re **ready, compartmentalized, and low-risk** from day one.

### ✅ Essentials for All Travelers
- [ ] **Scan & back up ID, passport, tickets** to encrypted cloud storage (Proton Drive, Tresorit)  
- [ ] Notify only necessary contacts of your **real itinerary** — not on social media  
- [ ] Check destination laws: SIM requirements, border search rules, surveillance norms  
- [ ] Update your devices and apps. Apply **security patches** before travel  
- [ ] Install and test your **VPN**, password manager, and messaging apps  
- [ ] Set device to **alphanumeric passcode**, disable biometrics  
- [ ] Enable **remote wipe** (iCloud, MDM, or Android Find My Device)

### 🔒 For High-Risk Roles
- [ ] Prepare a **clean travel phone** or **burner phone** with alias accounts only  
- [ ] Avoid carrying your primary work or personal device  
- [ ] Create travel-only Apple/Google IDs, alias email addresses (SimpleLogin, Proton)  
- [ ] Offload sensitive files from your device to encrypted storage — don’t carry them  
- [ ] Prepare **emergency contact card**, stored on paper or in encrypted note  
- [ ] Print physical directions to safe locations in case of connectivity loss

## 🧠 Core OPSEC Travel Principles

| Principle         | Action |
|------------------|--------|
| **Blend In**      | Dress simple, speak less, observe more. Avoid standing out. |

| **Compartmentalize** | Keep work/personal life, devices, and data separated. |
| **Stay Situationally Aware** | Know your surroundings, exits, and who’s watching. |

## 🏨 Hotel Security

### ✅ What to Check When You Arrive:
- [ ] Nearest **two exit routes** (stairs, fire escapes)  
- [ ] **Camera locations** in hallways and public spaces  
- [ ] Presence of **smart TVs, speakers, or hubs** — unplug or disable  
- [ ] Who can access your room — consider using **Do Not Disturb**

### 🧠 Smart Behavior:
- Don’t use real name/email for Wi-Fi or hotel loyalty programs  
- Keep **devices with you or in a Faraday pouch**, not in safes  
- Don’t discuss sensitive work or plans in the room — smart devices might record  
- Keep a **“go bag” ready** if fast departure is ever needed

## 🚖 Transit & Public Travel (Taxis, Metro, Airports)

| Scenario | OPSEC Tip |
|----------|-----------|
| **Taxis/Ride-share** | Use general-purpose phrases: “visiting friends”, “remote worker” – avoid oversharing |
| **Public Transport** | Don’t reuse ID-linked transport cards; prefer cash tickets or unregistered passes |
| **Airports** | Power off phone 30–60 min before security. Avoid unlocking unless required. Use travel-only devices |
| **Repeat movement patterns** | Vary transit routes and times if you’re staying long-term |

---

## 📡 Connectivity & Data Access

| Risk | Defense |
|------|---------|
| Public Wi-Fi | Only connect with VPN. Never enter credentials on captive portals |
| SIM Tracking | Use **pseudonymous SIM or eSIM** if available. Avoid SIMs tied to passport or home address |
| Account Access | Avoid logging into personal accounts on travel devices. Use alias accounts if needed |
| DNS/Data Fingerprinting | Route traffic through a privacy DNS (e.g. NextDNS) or VPN |

## 📦 Optional Security Kit for Higher-Risk Roles

### 🎒 Bugout / Travel Security Kit (Adjust for personal preferences)
